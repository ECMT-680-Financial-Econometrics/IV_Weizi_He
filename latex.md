\section*{Abstract}
This report investigates the impact of compulsory school attendance on educational attainment and earnings. Utilizing quarter of birth as an instrumental variable, the study explores the causal relationship between education and earnings, highlighting the significant influence of compulsory schooling laws.

\section{Introduction}
This research addresses the intricate relationship between compulsory school attendance, educational attainment, and subsequent earnings. The study aims to answer how school start age policies and compulsory attendance laws affect an individual's schooling and earnings, using an instrumental variable approach with quarter of birth as the instrument.

\section{Literature Review}
The report reviews previous studies on the impact of educational policies on earnings and educational outcomes. It identifies gaps in understanding the causal relationship between education and earnings, especially considering the effect of compulsory schooling laws.

\section{Methodology}
The study employs an econometric analysis using census data. The primary method involves regression analysis, with quarter of birth serving as an instrumental variable to identify the causal impact of education on earnings.

\section{Findings}
The findings reveal that individuals born early in the year have less schooling, influenced by school start age policies and compulsory schooling laws. The regression results indicate a significant relationship between education and earnings, with the instrumental variable approach confirming little bias in conventional estimates.
